# Integrating Another Learner

In order to integrate a learning algorithm into [%mlr] some interface code has to be written.
Three functions are mandatory for each learner.

* First, define a new learner class with a name, description, capabilities, parameters,
  and a few other things.
  (An object of this class can then be generated by [&makeLearner].)
* Second, you need to provide a function that calls the learner function and builds the
  model given data (which makes it possible to invoke training by calling [%mlr]'s [&train]
  function).
* Finally, a prediction function that returns predicted values given new data is required
  (which enables invoking prediction by calling [%mlr]'s [predict](&predict.WrappedModel)
  function).

Technically, integrating a learning method means introducing a new S3 [class](&base::class)
and implementing the corresponding methods for the generic functions [makeRLerner](&RLearner),
[&trainLearner], and [&predictLearner].
Therefore we start with a quick overview of the involved [classes](&base::class) and
constructor functions.


## Classes, constructors, and naming schemes
As you already know [&makeLearner] generates an object of class [Learner](&makeLearner).

```{r}
class(makeLearner(cl = "classif.lda"))

class(makeLearner(cl = "regr.lm"))

class(makeLearner(cl = "surv.coxph"))

class(makeLearner(cl = "cluster.kmeans"))

class(makeLearner(cl = "multilabel.rFerns"))
```

The first element of each [class](&base::class) attribute vector is the name of the learner
class passed to the `cl` argument of [&makeLearner].
Obviously, this adheres to the naming conventions

* ``"classif.<R_method_name>"`` for classification,
* ``"multilabel.<R_method_name>"`` for multilabel classification,
* ``"regr.<R_method_name>"`` for regression,
* ``"surv.<R_method_name>"`` for survival analysis, and
* ``"cluster.<R_method_name>"`` for clustering.

Additionally, there exist intermediate classes that reflect the type of learning problem, i.e.,
all classification learners inherit from [RLearnerClassif](&RLearner), all regression learners
from [RLearnerRegr](&RLearner) and so on.
Their superclasses are [&RLearner] and finally [Learner](&makeLearner).
For all these (sub)classes there exist constructor functions [makeRLearner](&RLearner),
[makeRLearnerClassif](&RLearner), [makeRLearneRegr](&RLearner) etc. that are called
internally by [&makeLearner].

A short side remark:
As you might have noticed there does not exist a special learner class for
[cost-sensitive classification (costsens)](cost_sensitive_classif.md) with example-specific
costs. This type of learning task is currently exclusively handled through [wrappers](wrapper.md)
like [&makeCostSensWeightedPairsWrapper].

In the following we show how to integrate learners for the five types of learning tasks
mentioned above.
Defining a completely new type of learner that has special properties and does not fit into
one of the existing schemes is of course possible, but much more advanced and not covered
here.

We use a classification example to explain some general principles (so even if you are
interested in integrating a learner for another type of learning task you might want to read
the following section).
Examples for other types of learning tasks are shown later on.


## Classification
We show how the [Linear Discriminant Analysis](&MASS::lda) from
package [%MASS] has been integrated
into the classification learner ``classif.lda`` in [%mlr] as an example.


### Definition of the learner
The minimal information required to define a learner is the [%mlr] name of the
learner, its package, the parameter set, and the set of properties of your
learner. In addition, you may provide a human-readable name, a short name and a
note with information relevant to users of the learner.

First, name your learner. According to the naming conventions above the name starts with
``classif.`` and we choose ``classif.lda``.

Second, we need to define the parameters of the learner. These are any options
that can be set when running it to change how it learns, how input is
interpreted, how and what output is generated, and so on. [%mlr] provides a
number of functions to define parameters, a complete list can be found in the
documentation of [LearnerParam](&ParamHelpers::LearnerParam) of the
[%ParamHelpers] package.

In our example, we have discrete and numeric parameters, so we use
[makeDiscreteLearnerParam](&ParamHelpers::LearnerParam) and
[makeNumericLearnerParam](&ParamHelpers::LearnerParam) to incorporate the
complete description of the parameters. We include all possible values for
discrete parameters and lower and upper bounds for numeric parameters. Strictly
speaking it is not necessary to provide bounds for all parameters and if this
information is not available they can be estimated, but providing accurate and
specific information here makes it possible to tune the learner much better (see
the section on [tuning](tune.md)).

Next, we add information on the properties of the learner (see also the section
on [learners](learner.md)). Which types of features are supported (numerics,
factors)? Are case weights supported? Are class weights supported? Can the method deal
with missing values in the features and deal with NA's in a meaningful way (not ``na.omit``)?
Are one-class, two-class, multi-class problems supported? Can the learner predict
posterior probabilities?

If the learner supports class weights the name of the relevant learner parameter
can be specified via argument `class.weights.param`.

Below is the complete code for the definition of the LDA learner. It has one
discrete parameter, ``method``, and two continuous ones, ``nu`` and ``tol``. It
supports classification problems with two or more classes and can deal with
numeric and factor explanatory variables. It can predict posterior
probabilities.

```{r, include=FALSE, purl= FALSE}
showFunctionDef = function(fun, name = gsub("^[^:]*:+", "", deparse(substitute(fun)))) {
  l = deparse(fun)
  l[1] = paste(name, l[1], sep = " = ")
  l
}
```
```{r}
makeRLearner.classif.lda = function() {
  makeRLearnerClassif(
    cl = "classif.lda",
    package = "MASS",
    par.set = makeParamSet(
      makeDiscreteLearnerParam(id = "method", default = "moment", values = c("moment", "mle", "mve", "t")),
      makeNumericLearnerParam(id = "nu", lower = 2, requires = quote(method == "t")),
      makeNumericLearnerParam(id = "tol", default = 1e-4, lower = 0),
      makeDiscreteLearnerParam(id = "predict.method", values = c("plug-in", "predictive", "debiased"),
        default = "plug-in", when = "predict"),
      makeLogicalLearnerParam(id = "CV", default = FALSE, tunable = FALSE)
    ),
    properties = c("twoclass", "multiclass", "numerics", "factors", "prob"),
    name = "Linear Discriminant Analysis",
    short.name = "lda",
    note = "Learner param 'predict.method' maps to 'method' in predict.lda."
  )
}
```


### Creating the training function of the learner
Once the learner has been defined, we need to tell [%mlr] how to call it to
train a model. The name of the function has to start with ``trainLearner.``,
followed by the [%mlr] name of the learner as defined above (``classif.lda``
here). The prototype of the function looks as follows.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
function(.learner, .task, .subset, .weights = NULL, ...) { }
```

This function must fit a model on the data of the task ``.task`` with regard to
the subset defined in the integer vector ``.subset`` and the parameters passed
in the ``...`` arguments. Usually, the data should be extracted from the task
using [&getTaskData]. This will take care of any subsetting as well. It must
return the fitted model. [%mlr] assumes no special data type for the return
value -- it will be passed to the predict function we are going to define below,
so any special code the learner may need can be encapsulated there.

For our example, the definition of the function looks like this. In addition to
the data of the task, we also need the formula that describes what to predict.
We use the function [&getTaskFormula] to extract this from the task.
```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::trainLearner.classif.lda), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
trainLearner.classif.lda = function(.learner, .task, .subset, .weights = NULL,  ...) {
  f = getTaskFormula(.task)
  MASS::lda(f, data = getTaskData(.task, .subset), ...)
}
```


### Creating the prediction method
Finally, the prediction function needs to be defined. The name of this function
starts with ``predictLearner.``, followed again by the [%mlr] name of the
learner. The prototype of the function is as follows.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
function(.learner, .model, .newdata, ...) { }
```

It must predict for the new observations in the `data.frame` ``.newdata`` with
the wrapped model ``.model``, which is returned from the training function.
The actual model the learner built is stored in the ``$learner.model`` member
and can be accessed simply through ``.model$learner.model``.

For classification, you have to return a factor of predicted classes if
``.learner$predict.type`` is ``"response"``, or a matrix of predicted
probabilities if ``.learner$predict.type`` is ``"prob"`` and this type of
prediction is supported by the learner. In the latter case the matrix must have
the same number of columns as there are classes in the task and the columns have
to be named by the class names.

The definition for LDA looks like this. It is pretty much just a straight
pass-through of the arguments to the [predict](&base::predict) function and some extraction of
prediction data depending on the type of prediction requested.
```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::predictLearner.classif.lda), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(indent=2, width.cutoff=100)}
predictLearner.classif.lda = function(.learner, .model, .newdata, predict.method = "plug-in", ...) {
  p = predict(.model$learner.model, newdata = .newdata, method = predict.method, ...)
  if(.learner$predict.type == "response")
    return(p$class)
  else
    return(p$posterior)
}
```


## Regression
The main difference for regression is that the type of predictions are different
(numeric instead of labels or probabilities) and that not all of the properties
are relevant. In particular, whether one-, two-, or multi-class problems and
posterior probabilities are supported is not applicable.

Apart from this, everything explained above applies. Below is the definition for
the [earth](&earth::earth) learner from the
[%earth] package.

```{r}
makeRLearner.regr.earth = function() {
  makeRLearnerRegr(
    cl = "regr.earth",
    package = "earth",
    par.set = makeParamSet(
      makeLogicalLearnerParam(id = "keepxy", default = FALSE, tunable = FALSE),
      makeNumericLearnerParam(id = "trace", default = 0, upper = 10, tunable = FALSE),
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "degree", default = 1L, lower = 1L),
      makeNumericLearnerParam(id = "penalty"),
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "nk", lower = 0L),
      makeNumericLearnerParam(id = "thres", default = 0.001),
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "minspan", default = 0L),
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "endspan", default = 0L),
      makeNumericLearnerParam(id = "newvar.penalty", default = 0),
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "fast.k", default = 20L, lower = 0L),
      makeNumericLearnerParam(id = "fast.beta", default = 1),
      makeDiscreteLearnerParam(id = "pmethod", default = "backward",
        values = c("backward", "none", "exhaustive", "forward", "seqrep", "cv")),
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "nprune")
    ),
    properties = c("numerics", "factors"),
    name = "Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines",
    short.name = "earth",
    note = ""
  )
}
```
```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::trainLearner.regr.earth), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
trainLearner.regr.earth = function(.learner, .task, .subset, .weights = NULL,  ...) {
  f = getTaskFormula(.task)
  earth::earth(f, data = getTaskData(.task, .subset), ...)
}
```
```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::predictLearner.regr.earth), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
predictLearner.regr.earth = function(.learner, .model, .newdata, ...) {
  predict(.model$learner.model, newdata = .newdata)[, 1L]
}
```

Again most of the data is passed straight through to/from the train/predict
functions of the learner.


## Survival analysis
For survival analysis, you have to return so-called linear predictors in order to compute
the default measure for this task type, the [cindex](measures.md) (for
``.learner$predict.type`` == ``"response"``). For ``.learner$predict.type`` == ``"prob"``,
there is no substantially meaningful measure (yet). You may either ignore this case or return
something like predicted survival curves (cf. example below).

There are three properties that are specific to survival learners:
"rcens", "lcens" and "icens", defining the type(s) of censoring a learner can handle -- right,
left and/or interval censored.

Let's have a look at how the [Cox Proportional Hazard Model](&survival::coxph) from
package [%survival] has been integrated
into the survival learner ``surv.coxph`` in [%mlr] as an example:

```{r}
makeRLearner.surv.coxph = function() {
  makeRLearnerSurv(
    cl = "surv.coxph",
    package = "survival",
    par.set = makeParamSet(
      makeDiscreteLearnerParam(id = "ties", default = "efron", values = c("efron", "breslow", "exact")),
      makeLogicalLearnerParam(id = "singular.ok", default = TRUE),
      makeNumericLearnerParam(id = "eps", default = 1e-09, lower = 0),
      makeNumericLearnerParam(id = "toler.chol", default = .Machine$double.eps^0.75, lower = 0),
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "iter.max", default = 20L, lower = 1L),
      makeNumericLearnerParam(id = "toler.inf", default = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps^0.75), lower = 0),
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "outer.max", default = 10L, lower = 1L),
      makeLogicalLearnerParam(id = "model", default = FALSE, tunable = FALSE),
      makeLogicalLearnerParam(id = "x", default = FALSE, tunable = FALSE),
      makeLogicalLearnerParam(id = "y", default = TRUE, tunable = FALSE)
    ),
    properties = c("missings", "numerics", "factors", "weights", "prob", "rcens"),
    name = "Cox Proportional Hazard Model",
    short.name = "coxph",
    note = ""
  )
}
```
```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::trainLearner.surv.coxph), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(indent=2, width.cutoff=100)}
trainLearner.surv.coxph = function(.learner, .task, .subset, .weights = NULL,  ...) {
  f = getTaskFormula(.task)
  data = getTaskData(.task, subset = .subset)
  if (is.null(.weights)) {
    mod = survival::coxph(formula = f, data = data, ...)
  } else  {
    mod = survival::coxph(formula = f, data = data, weights = .weights, ...)
  }
  if (.learner$predict.type == "prob")
    mod = attachTrainingInfo(mod, list(surv.range = range(getTaskTargets(.task)[, 1L])))
  mod
}
```
```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::predictLearner.surv.coxph), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(indent=2, width.cutoff=100)}
predictLearner.surv.coxph = function(.learner, .model, .newdata, ...) {
  if(.learner$predict.type == "response") {
    predict(.model$learner.model, newdata = .newdata, type = "lp", ...)
  } else if (.learner$predict.type == "prob") {
    surv.range = getTrainingInfo(.model$learner.model)$surv.range
    times = seq(from = surv.range[1L], to = surv.range[2L], length.out = 1000)
    t(summary(survival::survfit(.model$learner.model, newdata = .newdata, se.fit = FALSE, conf.int = FALSE), times = times)$surv)
  } else {
    stop("Unknown predict type")
  }
}
```


## Clustering
For clustering, you have to return a numeric vector with the IDs of the clusters
that the respective datum has been assigned to. The numbering should start at 1.

Below is the definition for the [FarthestFirst](&RWeka::FarthestFirst) learner
from the [%RWeka] package. Weka
starts the IDs of the clusters at 0, so we add 1 to the predicted clusters.
RWeka has a different way of setting learner parameters; we use the special
``Weka_control`` function to do this.

```{r}
makeRLearner.cluster.FarthestFirst = function() {
  makeRLearnerCluster(
    cl = "cluster.FarthestFirst",
    package = "RWeka",
    par.set = makeParamSet(
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "N", default = 2L, lower = 1L),
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "S", default = 1L, lower = 1L),
      makeLogicalLearnerParam(id = "output-debug-info", default = FALSE, tunable = FALSE)
    ),
    properties = c("numerics"),
    name = "FarthestFirst Clustering Algorithm",
    short.name = "farthestfirst"
  )
}
```
```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::trainLearner.cluster.FarthestFirst), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(indent=2, width.cutoff=100)}
trainLearner.cluster.FarthestFirst = function(.learner, .task, .subset, .weights = NULL,  ...) {
  ctrl = RWeka::Weka_control(...)
  RWeka::FarthestFirst(getTaskData(.task, .subset), control = ctrl)
}
```
```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::predictLearner.cluster.FarthestFirst), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(indent=2, width.cutoff=100)}
predictLearner.cluster.FarthestFirst = function(.learner, .model, .newdata, ...) {
  # RWeka returns cluster indices (i.e. starting from 0, which some tools don't like
  as.integer(predict(.model$learner.model, .newdata, ...)) + 1L
}
```


## Multilabel classification
As stated in the [multilabel](multilabel.md) section, multilabel classification
methods can be divided into problem transformation methods and algorithm adaptation methods.

At this moment the only problem transformation method implemented in [%mlr]
is the [binary relevance method](&makeMultilabelBinaryRelevanceWrapper). Integrating more of
these methods requires good knowledge of the architecture of the [%mlr] package.

The integration of an algorithm adaptation multilabel classification learner is easier and
works very similar to the normal multiclass-classification.
In contrast to the multiclass case, not all of the learner properties are relevant.
In particular, whether one-, two-, or multi-class problems are supported is not applicable.
Furthermore the prediction function output must be a matrix
with each prediction of a label in one column and the names of the labels
as column names. If ``.learner$predict.type`` is ``"response"`` the predictions must
be logical. If ``.learner$predict.type`` is ``"prob"`` and this type of
prediction is supported by the learner, the matrix must consist of predicted
probabilities.

Below is the definition of the [rFerns](&rFerns::rFerns) learner from the
[%rFerns] package, which does not support probability predictions.

```{r}
makeRLearner.multilabel.rFerns = function() {
  makeRLearnerMultilabel(
    cl = "multilabel.rFerns",
    package = "rFerns",
    par.set = makeParamSet(
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "depth", default = 5L),
      makeIntegerLearnerParam(id = "ferns", default = 1000L)
    ),
    properties = c("numerics", "factors", "ordered"),
    name = "Random ferns",
    short.name = "rFerns",
    note = ""
  )
}
```
```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::trainLearner.multilabel.rFerns), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(indent=2, width.cutoff=100)}
trainLearner.multilabel.rFerns = function(.learner, .task, .subset, .weights = NULL, ...) {
  d = getTaskData(.task, .subset, target.extra = TRUE)
  rFerns::rFerns(x = d$data, y = as.matrix(d$target), ...)
}
```
```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::predictLearner.multilabel.rFerns), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
predictLearner.multilabel.rFerns = function(.learner, .model, .newdata, ...) {
  as.matrix(predict(.model$learner.model, .newdata, ...))
}
```


## Creating a new method for extracting feature importance values
Some learners, for example decision trees and random forests, can calculate feature importance
values, which can be extracted from a [fitted model](&makeWrappedModel) using function
[&getFeatureImportance].

If your newly integrated learner supports this you need to

* add `"featimp"` to the learner properties and
* implement a new S3 method for function [&getFeatureImportanceLearner] (which later is called
  internally by [&getFeatureImportance])

in order to make this work.

This method takes the [&Learner] `.learner`, the [WrappedModel](&makeWrappedModel) `.model`
and potential further arguments and calculates or extracts the feature importance.
It must return a named vector of importance values.

Below are two simple examples.
In case of `"classif.rpart"` the feature importance values can be easily extracted from the
fitted model.

```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::getFeatureImportanceLearner.classif.rpart), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(indent=2, width.cutoff=100)}
getFeatureImportanceLearner.classif.rpart = function(.learner, .model, ...) {
  mod = getLearnerModel(.model)
  mod$variable.importance
}
```

For the [random forest](&randomForestSRC::rfsrc) from package [%randomForestSRC] function
[vimp](&randomForestSRC::vimp) is called.

```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::getFeatureImportanceLearner.classif.randomForestSRC), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(indent=2, width.cutoff=100)}
getFeatureImportanceLearner.classif.randomForestSRC = function(.learner, .model, ...) {
  mod = getLearnerModel(.model)
  randomForestSRC::vimp(mod, ...)$importance[, "all"]
}
```


## Creating a new method for extracting out-of-bag predictions
Many ensemble learners generate out-of-bag predictions (OOB predictions) automatically.
[%mlr] provides the function [&getOOBPreds] to access these predictions in the [%mlr] framework.

If your newly integrated learner is able to calculate OOB predictions and you want to be
able to access them in [%mlr] via [&getOOBPreds] you need to

* add `"oobpreds"` to the learner properties and
* implement a new S3 method for function [&getOOBPredsLearner] (which later is called
  internally by [&getOOBPreds]).

This method takes the [Learner](&makeLearner) `.learner` and the [WrappedModel](&makeWrappedModel)
`.model` and extracts the OOB predictions.
It must return the predictions in the same format as the [&predictLearner] function.

```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::getOOBPredsLearner.classif.randomForest), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(indent=2, width.cutoff=100)}
```


## Registering your learner
If your interface code to a new learning algorithm exists only locally, i.e., it is not (yet)
merged into [%mlr] or does not live in an extra package with a proper namespace you might want
to register the new S3 methods to make sure that these are found by, e.g., [&listLearners].
You can do this as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
registerS3method("makeRLearner", "<awesome_new_learner_class>", makeRLearner.<awesome_new_learner_class>)
registerS3method("trainLearner", "<awesome_new_learner_class>", trainLearner.<awesome_new_learner_class>)
registerS3method("predictLearner", "<awesome_new_learner_class>", predictLearner.<awesome_new_learner_class>)
```

If you have written more methods, for example in order to extract feature importance values
or out-of-bag predictions these also need to be registered in the same manner, for example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
registerS3method("getFeatureImportanceLearner", "<awesome_new_learner_class>",
  getFeatureImportanceLearner.<awesome_new_learner_class>)
```

For the new learner to work with parallelization, you may have to export the new
methods explicitly:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
parallelExport("trainLearner.<awesome_new_learner_class>", "predictLearner.<awesome_new_learner_class>")
```


## Further information for developers
If you haven't written a learner interface for private use only, but intend to send a pull
request to have it included in the [%mlr] package there are a few things to take care of,
most importantly unit testing!

For general information about contributing to the package, unit testing, version control setup
and the like please also read the
[coding guidelines in the mlr Wiki](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/wiki/mlr-Coding-Guidelines).


* The R file containing the interface code should adhere to the naming convention
`RLearner_<type>_<learner_name>.R`, e.g., `RLearner_classif_lda.R`, see for example
<https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/blob/master/R/RLearner_classif_lda.R> and contain the
necessary roxygen `@export` tags to register the S3 methods in the NAMESPACE.

* The learner interfaces should work out of the box without requiring any parameters to be set,
e.g., `train("classif.lda", iris.task)` should run.
Sometimes, this makes it necessary to change or set some additional defaults as explained above
and -- very important -- informing the user about this in the `note`.

* The parameter set of the learner should be as complete as possible.

* Every learner interface must be unit tested.


### Unit testing
The tests make sure that we get the same results when the learner is invoked through the [%mlr]
interface and when using the original functions.
If you are not familiar or want to learn more about unit testing and package [%testthat]
have a look at [the Testing chapter in Hadley Wickham's R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html).

In [%mlr] all unit tests are in the following directory:
<https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/tree/master/tests/testthat>.
For each learner interface there is an individual file whose name follows the scheme
`test_<type>_<learner_name>.R`, for example
<https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/blob/master/tests/testthat/test_classif_lda.R>.

Below is a snippet from the tests of the lda interface
<https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/blob/master/tests/testthat/test_classif_lda.R>.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
test_that("classif_lda", {
  requirePackagesOrSkip("MASS", default.method = "load")

  set.seed(getOption("mlr.debug.seed"))
  m = MASS::lda(formula = multiclass.formula, data = multiclass.train)
  set.seed(getOption("mlr.debug.seed"))
  p = predict(m, newdata = multiclass.test)

  testSimple("classif.lda", multiclass.df, multiclass.target, multiclass.train.inds, p$class)
  testProb("classif.lda", multiclass.df, multiclass.target, multiclass.train.inds, p$posterior)
})
```

The tests make use of numerous helper objects and helper functions.
All of these are defined in the `helper_` files in
<https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/blob/master/tests/testthat/>.

In the above code the first line just loads package [%MASS] or skips the test if the package is
not available.
The objects `multiclass.formula`, `multiclass.train`, `multiclass.test` etc. are defined
in <https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/blob/master/tests/testthat/helper_objects.R>.
We tried to choose fairly self-explanatory names:
For example `multiclass` indicates a multi-class classification problem, `multiclass.train`
contains data for training, `multiclass.formula` a [formula](&stats::formula) object etc.

The test fits an lda model on the training set and makes predictions on the test set
using the original functions [lda](&MASS::lda) and [predict.lda](&MASS::predict.lda).
The helper functions `testSimple` and `testProb` perform training and prediction on the same
data using the [%mlr] interface -- `testSimple` for `predict.type = "response` and `testProbs` for
`predict.type = "prob"` -- and check if the predicted class labels and probabilities coincide
with the outcomes `p$class` and `p$posterior`.

In order to get reproducible results seeding is required for many learners.
The `"mlr.debug.seed"` works as follows:
When invoking the tests the option `"mlr.debug.seed"` is set
(see <https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/blob/master/tests/testthat/helper_zzz.R>), and
`set.seed(getOption("mlr.debug.seed"))` is used to specify the seed.
Internally, [%mlr]'s
[train](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/blob/master/R/train.R#L73) and
[predict.WrappedModel](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/blob/master/R/predict.R#L100)
functions check if the `"mlr.debug.seed"` option is set and if yes, also specify the seed.

Note that the option `"mlr.debug.seed"` is only set for testing, so no seeding happens in
normal usage of [%mlr].

Let's look at a second example.
Many learners have parameters that are commonly changed or tuned and it is important to make
sure that these are passed through correctly.
Below is a snippet from <https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/blob/master/tests/testthat/test_regr_randomForest.R>.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
test_that("regr_randomForest", {
  requirePackagesOrSkip("randomForest", default.method = "load")

  parset.list = list(
    list(),
    list(ntree = 5, mtry = 2),
    list(ntree = 5, mtry = 4),
    list(proximity = TRUE, oob.prox = TRUE),
    list(nPerm = 3)
  )

  old.predicts.list = list()

  for (i in 1:length(parset.list)) {
    parset = parset.list[[i]]
    pars = list(formula = regr.formula, data = regr.train)
    pars = c(pars, parset)
    set.seed(getOption("mlr.debug.seed"))
    m = do.call(randomForest::randomForest, pars)
    set.seed(getOption("mlr.debug.seed"))
    p = predict(m, newdata = regr.test, type = "response")
    old.predicts.list[[i]] = p
  }

  testSimpleParsets("regr.randomForest", regr.df, regr.target,
    regr.train.inds, old.predicts.list, parset.list)
})
```

All tested parameter configurations are collected in the `parset.list`.
In order to make sure that the default parameter configuration is tested the first element
of the `parset.list` is an empty [list](base::list).
Then we simply loop over all parameter settings and store the resulting predictions in
`old.predicts.list`.
Again the helper function `testSimpleParsets` does the same using the [%mlr] interface
and compares the outcomes.

Additional to tests for individual learners we also have general tests that loop through all
integrated learners and make for example sure that learners have the correct properties
(e.g. a learner with property `"factors"` can cope with [factor](base::factor) features,
a learner with property `"weights"` takes observation weights into account properly etc.).
For example <https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/blob/master/tests/testthat/test_learners_all_classif.R>
runs through all classification learners.
Similar tests exist for all types of learning methods like regression, cluster and survival analysis
as well as multilabel classification.

In order to run all tests for, e.g., classification learners on your machine you can invoke
the tests from within **R** by

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::test("mlr", filter = "classif")
```

or from the command line using [Michel's rt tool](https://github.com/rdatsci/rt)

```
rtest --filter=classif
```

# Creating an Imputation Method

Function [&makeImputeMethod] permits to create your own imputation method.
For this purpose you need to specify a *learn* function that extracts the necessary
information and an *impute* function that does the actual imputation.
The *learn* and *impute* functions both have at least the following formal arguments:

* ``data`` is a [data.frame](&base::data.frame) with missing values in some features.
* ``col`` indicates the feature to be imputed.
* ``target`` indicates the target variable(s) in a supervised learning task.


## Example: Imputation using the mean
Let's have a look at function [imputeMean](&imputations).

```{r, include=FALSE, purl= FALSE}
showFunctionDef = function(fun, name = sub("^[^:]*:+", "", deparse(substitute(fun)))) {
  l = deparse(fun)
  l[1] = paste(name, l[1], sep = " = ")
  l
}
```
```{r, code=showFunctionDef(imputeMean), eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, purl = FALSE}
```

[imputeMean](&imputations) calls the unexported [%mlr] function `simpleImpute` which is defined as follows.

```{r, code=showFunctionDef(mlr:::simpleImpute), eval=FALSE, tidy = TRUE, purl= FALSE}
```

The *learn* function calculates the mean of the non-missing observations in column ``col``.
The mean is passed via argument ``const`` to the *impute* function that replaces all missing values
in feature ``col``.


## Writing your own imputation method
Now let's write a new imputation method:
A frequently used simple technique for longitudinal data is *last observation
carried forward* (LOCF). Missing values are replaced by the most recent observed value.

In the **R** code below the *learn* function determines the last observed value previous to
each ``NA`` (``values``) as well as the corresponding number of consecutive ``NA's`` (``times``).
The *impute* function generates a vector by replicating the entries in ``values``
according to ``times`` and replaces the ``NA's`` in feature ``col``.

```{r}
imputeLOCF = function() {
  makeImputeMethod(
    learn = function(data, target, col) {
      x = data[[col]]
      ind = is.na(x)
      dind = diff(ind)
      lastValue = which(dind == 1)  # position of the last observed value previous to NA
      lastNA = which(dind == -1)    # position of the last of potentially several consecutive NA's
      values = x[lastValue]         # last observed value previous to NA
      times = lastNA - lastValue    # number of consecutive NA's
      return(list(values = values, times = times))
    },
    impute = function(data, target, col, values, times) {
      x = data[[col]]
      replace(x, is.na(x), rep(values, times))
    }
  )
}
```

Note that this function is just for demonstration and is lacking some checks for real-world
usage (for example 'What should happen if the first value in `x` is already missing?').
Below it is used to impute the missing values in features ``Ozone`` and ``Solar.R`` in the
[airquality](&datasets::airquality) data set.

```{r}
data(airquality)
imp = impute(airquality, cols = list(Ozone = imputeLOCF(), Solar.R = imputeLOCF()),
  dummy.cols = c("Ozone", "Solar.R"))
head(imp$data, 10)
```

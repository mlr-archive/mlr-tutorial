# Machine Learning in R: mlr Tutorial
This `r if (dev == "pdf") "document" else "web page"` provides an in-depth introduction to
the [Machine Learning in R: mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) framework for machine
learning experiments in **R**.

We focus on the comprehension of the basic functions and applications.
More detailed technical information can be found in the [manual pages](%mlr) which
are regularly updated and reflect the documentation of the
[current package version on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlr/index.html).

An offline version of this tutorial is available for download

* [here](https://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/release/mlr_tutorial.zip) for the
  current mlr release on CRAN and
* [here](https://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/devel/mlr_tutorial.zip) for
  the mlr devel version on GitHub.

The tutorial explains the basic analysis of a data set step by step.
Please refer to sections of the menu above: Basics, Advanced, Extend and Appendix.

During the tutorial we present various simple examples from classification, regression, cluster and
survival analysis to illustrate the main features of the package.

## Quick start
Here we show the [%mlr] workflow to train, make predictions, and evaluate a learner on a
classification problem. We walk through 5 basic steps that work on any learning problem or
method supported by [%mlr].

```{r}
library(mlr)
data(iris)

## 1) Define the task
## Specify the type of analysis (e.g. classification) and provide data and response variable
task = makeClassifTask(data = iris, target = "Species")

## 2) Define the learner
## Choose a specific algorithm (e.g. linear discriminant analysis)
lrn = makeLearner("classif.lda")

n = nrow(iris)
train.set = sample(2/3 * n)
test.set = setdiff(1:n, train.set)

## 3) Fit the model
## Train the learner on the task using a random subset of the data as training set
model = train(lrn, task, subset = train.set)

## 4) Make predictions
## Predict values of the response variable for new observations by the trained model
## using the other part of the data as test set
pred = predict(model, task = task, subset = test.set)

## 5) Evaluate the learner
## Calculate the mean misclassification error and accuracy
performance(pred, measures = list(mmce, acc))
```

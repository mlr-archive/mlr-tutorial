# Exploring Learner Predictions

Learners use features to make predictions but how those features are used is often not apparent.
[%mlr] can estimate the dependence of a learned function on a subset of the feature space using
[&generatePartialDependenceData].

Partial dependence plots reduce the potentially high dimensional function estimated by the
learner, and display a marginalized version of this function in a lower dimensional space.
For example suppose $Y = f(X) + \epsilon$, where $\mathbb{E}[\epsilon|X] = 0$. With $(X, Y)$
pairs drawn independently from this statistical model, a learner may estimate $\hat{f}$, which,
if $X$ is high dimensional can be uninterpretable. Suppose we want to approximate the relationship
between some subset of $X$. We partition $X$ into two sets, $X_s$ and $X_c$ such that
$X = X_s \cup X_c$, where $X_s$ is a subset of $X$ of interest.

The partial dependence of $f$ on $X_c$ is

$$f_{X_s} = \mathbb{E}_{X_c}f(X_s, X_c).$$

$X_c$ is integrated out. We use the following estimator:

$$\hat{f}_{X_s} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N \hat{f}(X_s, x_{ic}).$$

The individual conditional expectation of an observation can also be estimated using the above
algorithm absent the averaging, giving $\hat{f}^{(i)}_{X_s}$. This allows the discovery of
features of $\hat{f}$ that may be obscured by an aggregated summary of $\hat{f}$.

The partial derivative of the partial dependence function, $\frac{\partial \hat{f}_{X_s}}{\partial X_s}$,
and the individual conditional expectation function, $\frac{\partial \hat{f}^{(i)}_{X_s}}{\partial X_s}$,
can also be computed. For regression and survival tasks the partial derivative of a single
feature $X_s$ is the gradient of the partial dependence function, and for classification tasks
where the learner can output class probabilities the Jacobian. Note that if the learner produces
discontinuous partial dependence (e.g., piecewise constant functions such as decision trees,
ensembles of decision trees, etc.) the derivative will be 0 (where the function is not changing)
or trending towards positive or negative infinity (at the discontinuities where the derivative
is undefined). Plotting the partial dependence function of such learners may give the impression
that the function is not discontinuous because the prediction grid is not composed of all
discontinuous points in the predictor space. This results in a line interpolating that makes
the function appear to be piecewise linear (where the derivative would be defined except at
the boundaries of each piece).

The partial derivative can be informative regarding the additivity of the learned function
in certain features. If $\hat{f}^{(i)}_{X_s}$ is an additive function in a feature $X_s$,
then its partial derivative will not depend on any other features ($X_c$) that may have been
used by the learner. Variation in the estimated partial derivative indicates that there is a
region of interaction between $X_s$ and $X_c$ in $\hat{f}$. Similarly, instead of using the mean to estimate
the expected value of the function at different values of $X_s$, instead computing the variance
can highlight regions of interaction between $X_s$ and $X_c$.

See [Goldstein, Kapelner, Bleich, and Pitkin (2014)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6392) for more
details and their package [%ICEbox] for the original implementation. The algorithm works for
any supervised learner with classification, regression, and survival tasks.

## Generating PartialDdependences

Our implementation, following [%mlr]'s [visualization](visualization.md) pattern, consists
of the above mentioned function [&generatePartialDependenceData], as well as two visualization
functions, [&plotPartialDependence] and [&plotPartialDependenceGGVIS]. The former generates
input (objects of class [&PartialDependenceData]) for the latter.

The first step executed by [&generatePartialDependenceData] is to generate a feature grid for
every element of the character vector `features` passed. The data are given by the `input`
argument, which can be a [&Task] or a [data.frame](&base::data.frame). The feature grid can be generated in
several ways. A uniformly spaced grid of length `gridsize` (default 10) from the empirical
minimum to the empirical maximum is created by default, but arguments `fmin` and `fmax` may
be used to override the empirical default (the lengths of `fmin` and `fmax` must match the
length of `features`). Alternatively the feature data can be resampled, either by using a
bootstrap or by subsampling.

```{r}
lrn.classif = makeLearner("classif.ksvm", predict.type = "prob")
fit.classif = train(lrn.classif, iris.task)
pd = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.classif, iris.task, "Petal.Width")
pd
```

As noted above, $X_s$ does not have to be unidimensional. If it is not, the `interaction`
flag must be set to `TRUE`. Then the individual feature grids are combined using the Cartesian
product, and the estimator above is applied, producing the partial dependence for every combination
of unique feature values. If the `interaction` flag is `FALSE` (the default) then by default
$X_s$ is assumed unidimensional, and partial dependencies are generated for each feature separately.
The resulting output when `interaction = FALSE` has a column for each feature, and `NA` where
the feature was not used.

```{r}
pd.lst = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.classif, iris.task, c("Petal.Width", "Petal.Length"), FALSE)
head(pd.lst$data)

tail(pd.lst$data)
```

```{r}
pd.int = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.classif, iris.task, c("Petal.Width", "Petal.Length"), TRUE)
pd.int
```

At each step in the estimation of $\hat{f}_{X_s}$ a set of predictions of length $N$ is generated.
By default the mean prediction is used. For classification where `predict.type = "prob"` this
entails the mean class probabilities. However, other summaries of the predictions may be used.
For regression and survival tasks the function used here must either return one number or three,
and, if the latter, the numbers must be sorted lowest to highest. For classification tasks
the function must return a number for each level of the target feature.

As noted, the `fun` argument can be a function which returns three numbers (sorted low to high)
for a regression task. This allows further exploration of relative feature importance. If a
feature is relatively important, the bounds are necessarily tighter because the feature accounts
for more of the variance of the predictions, i.e., it is "used" more by the learner. More directly
setting `fun = var` identifies regions of interaction between $X_s$ and $X_c$.

```{r}
lrn.regr = makeLearner("regr.ksvm")
fit.regr = train(lrn.regr, bh.task)
pd.regr = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.regr, bh.task, "lstat", fun = median)
pd.regr
```

```{r}
pd.ci = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.regr, bh.task, "lstat",
  fun = function(x) quantile(x, c(.25, .5, .75)))
pd.ci
```

```{r}
pd.classif = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.classif, iris.task, "Petal.Length", fun = median)
pd.classif
```

In addition to bounds based on a summary of the distribution of the conditional expectation of each observation, learners which can estimate the variance of their predictions can also be used. The argument `bounds` is a numeric vector of length two which is added (so the first number should be negative) to the point prediction to produce a confidence interval for the partial dependence. The default is the .025 and .975 quantiles of the Gaussian distribution.

```{r}
fit.se = train(makeLearner("regr.randomForest", predict.type = "se"), bh.task)
pd.se = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.se, bh.task, c("lstat", "crim"))
head(pd.se$data)

tail(pd.se$data)
```

As previously mentioned if the aggregation function is not used, i.e., it is the identity,
then the conditional expectation of $\hat{f}^{(i)}_{X_s}$ is estimated. If `individual = TRUE`
then [&generatePartialDependenceData] returns $n$ partial dependence estimates made at each point in
the prediction grid constructed from the features.

```{r}
pd.ind.regr = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.regr, bh.task, "lstat", individual = TRUE)
pd.ind.regr
```

The resulting output, particularly the element `data` in the returned object, has an additional
column `idx` which gives the index of the observation to which the row pertains.

For classification tasks this index references both the class and the observation index.

```{r}
pd.ind.classif = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.classif, iris.task, "Petal.Length", individual = TRUE)
pd.ind.classif
```

Individual estimates of partial dependence can also be centered by predictions made at all $n$ observations
for a particular point in the prediction grid created by the features. This is controlled by
the argument `center` which is a list of the same length as the length of the `features`
argument and contains the values of the `features` desired.

```{r}
iris = getTaskData(iris.task)
pd.ind.classif = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.classif, iris.task, "Petal.Length", individual = TRUE,
  center = list("Petal.Length" = min(iris$Petal.Length)))
```

Partial derivatives can also be computed for individual partial dependence estimates and aggregate
partial dependence. This is restricted to a single feature at a time. The derivatives of
individual partial dependence estimates can be useful in finding regions of interaction between the
feature for which the derivative is estimated and the features excluded.

```{r}
pd.regr.der = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.regr, bh.task, "lstat", derivative = TRUE)
head(pd.regr.der$data)
```

```{r}
pd.regr.der.ind = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.regr, bh.task, "lstat", derivative = TRUE,
  individual = TRUE)
head(pd.regr.der.ind$data)
```

```{r}
pd.classif.der = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.classif, iris.task, "Petal.Width", derivative = TRUE)
head(pd.classif.der$data)
```

```{r}
pd.classif.der.ind = generatePartialDependenceData(fit.classif, iris.task, "Petal.Width", derivative = TRUE,
  individual = TRUE)
head(pd.classif.der.ind$data)
```

## Plotting partial dependences

Results from [&generatePartialDependenceData] can be visualized with [&plotPartialDependence]
and [&plotPartialDependenceGGVIS].

With one feature and a regression task the output is a line plot, with a point for each point
in the corresponding feature's grid.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
plotPartialDependence(pd.regr)
```

With a classification task, a line is drawn for each class, which gives the estimated partial
probability of that class for a particular point in the feature grid.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
plotPartialDependence(pd.classif)
```

For regression tasks, when the `fun` argument of [&generatePartialDependenceData] is used,
the bounds will automatically be displayed using a gray ribbon.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
plotPartialDependence(pd.ci)
```

The same goes for plots of partial dependences where the learner has `predict.type = "se"`.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
plotPartialDependence(pd.se)
```

When multiple features are passed to [&generatePartialDependenceData] but `interaction = FALSE`,
facetting is used to display each estimated bivariate relationship.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
plotPartialDependence(pd.lst)
```

When `interaction = TRUE` in the call to [&generatePartialDependenceData], one variable must
be chosen to be used for facetting, and a subplot for each value in the chosen feature's grid
is created, wherein the other feature's partial dependences within the facetting feature's
value are shown. Note that this type of plot is limited to two features.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
plotPartialDependence(pd.int, facet = "Petal.Length")
```

[&plotPartialDependenceGGVIS] can be used similarly, however, since [%ggvis] currently lacks
subplotting/facetting capabilities, the argument `interact` maps one feature to an interactive
sidebar where the user can select a value of one feature.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plotPartialDependenceGGVIS(pd.int, interact = "Petal.Length")
```

When `individual = TRUE` each individual conditional expectation curve is plotted.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
plotPartialDependence(pd.ind.regr)
```

When the individual curves are centered by subtracting the individual conditional expectations
estimated at a particular value of $X_s$ this results in a fixed intercept which aids in
visualizing variation in predictions made by $\hat{f}^{(i)}_{X_s}$.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
plotPartialDependence(pd.ind.classif)
```

Plotting partial derivative functions works the same as partial dependence. Below are estimates
of the derivative of the mean aggregated partial dependence function, and the individual
partial dependence functions for a regression and a classification task respectively.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
plotPartialDependence(pd.regr.der)
```

This suggests that $\hat{f}$ is not additive in `lstat` except in the neighborhood of $25$.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
plotPartialDependence(pd.regr.der.ind)
```

This suggests that `Petal.Width` interacts with some other feature in the neighborhood of
$(1.5, 2)$ for classes "virginica" and "versicolor".

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
plotPartialDependence(pd.classif.der.ind)
```

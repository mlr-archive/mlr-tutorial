# Nested Resampling

In order to obtain honest performance estimates for a learner all parts of the model building
like preprocessing and model selection steps should be included in the resampling, i.e.,
repeated for every pair of training/test data.
For steps that themselves require resampling like [parameter tuning](tune.md) or
[feature selection](feature_selection.md) (via the wrapper approach) this results in two
nested resampling loops.

![Nested Resampling Figure](img/nested_resampling.png "Nested Resampling Figure")

The graphic above illustrates nested resampling for parameter tuning with 3-fold cross-validation
in the outer and 4-fold cross-validation in the inner loop.

In the outer resampling loop, we have three pairs of training/test sets.
On each of these outer training sets parameter tuning is done, thereby executing the inner
resampling loop.
This way, we get one set of selected hyperparameters for each outer training set.
Then the learner is fitted on each outer training set using the corresponding selected
hyperparameters and its performance is evaluated on the outer test sets.

In [%mlr], you can get nested resampling for free without programming any looping by
using the [wrapper functionality](wrapper.md). This works as follows:

1. Generate a wrapped [Learner](&makeLearner) via function [&makeTuneWrapper] or [&makeFeatSelWrapper].
   Specify the inner resampling strategy using their `resampling` argument.
2. Call function [&resample] (see also the section about [resampling](resample.md)) and
   pass the outer resampling strategy to its `resampling` argument.

You can freely combine different inner and outer resampling strategies.

The outer strategy can be a resample description ([ResampleDesc](&makeResampleDesc)) or a
resample instance ([ResampleInstance](&makeResampleInstance)).
A common setup is prediction and performance evaluation on a fixed outer test set. This can
be achieved by using function [&makeFixedHoldoutInstance] to generate the outer
[ResampleInstance](&makeResampleInstance).

The inner resampling strategy should preferably be a [ResampleDesc](&makeResampleDesc), as the sizes
of the outer training sets might differ.
Per default, the inner resample description is instantiated once for every outer training set.
This way during tuning/feature selection all parameter or feature sets are compared
on the same inner training/test sets to reduce variance.
You can also turn this off using the `same.resampling.instance` argument of [makeTuneControl*](&TuneControl)
or [makeFeatSelControl*](&FeatSelControl).

Nested resampling is computationally expensive.
For this reason in the examples shown below we use relatively small search spaces and a low
number of resampling iterations. In practice, you normally have to increase both.
As this is computationally intensive you might want to have a look at section
[parallelization](parallelization.md).


## Tuning

As you might recall from the tutorial page about [tuning](tune.md), you need to define a search space by
function [makeParamSet](&ParamHelpers::makeParamSet), a search strategy by [makeTuneControl*](&TuneControl),
and a method to evaluate hyperparameter settings (i.e., the inner resampling strategy and a performance measure).

Below is a classification example.
We evaluate the performance of a support vector machine ([ksvm](&kernlab::ksvm)) with tuned
cost parameter `C` and RBF kernel parameter `sigma`.
We use 3-fold cross-validation in the outer and subsampling with 2 iterations in the inner
loop.
For tuning a grid search is used to find the hyperparameters with lowest error rate
([mmce](measures.md) is the default measure for classification).
The wrapped [Learner](&makeLearner) is generated by calling [&makeTuneWrapper].

Note that in practice the parameter set should be larger.
A common recommendation is `2^(-12:12)` for both `C` and `sigma`.

```{r}
## Tuning in inner resampling loop
ps = makeParamSet(
  makeDiscreteParam("C", values = 2^(-2:2)),
  makeDiscreteParam("sigma", values = 2^(-2:2))
)
ctrl = makeTuneControlGrid()
inner = makeResampleDesc("Subsample", iters = 2)
lrn = makeTuneWrapper("classif.ksvm", resampling = inner, par.set = ps, control = ctrl, show.info = FALSE)

## Outer resampling loop
outer = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)
r = resample(lrn, iris.task, resampling = outer, extract = getTuneResult, show.info = FALSE)

r
```

You can obtain the error rates on the 3 outer test sets by:
```{r}
r$measures.test
```


### Accessing the tuning result

We have kept the results of the tuning for further evaluations.
For example one might want to find out, if the best obtained configurations vary for the
different outer splits.
As storing entire models may be expensive (but possible by setting `models = TRUE`) we used
the `extract` option of [&resample].
Function [&getTuneResult] returns, among other things, the optimal hyperparameter values and
the [optimization path](&ParamHelpers::OptPath) for each iteration of the outer resampling loop.
Note that the performance values shown when printing `r$extract` are the aggregated performances
resulting from inner resampling on the outer training set for the best hyperparameter configurations
(not to be confused with `r$measures.test` shown above).
```{r}
r$extract

names(r$extract[[1]])
```

We can compare the optimal parameter settings obtained in the 3 resampling iterations.
As you can see, the optimal configuration usually depends on the data. You may
be able to identify a *range* of parameter settings that achieve good
performance though, e.g., the values for `C` should be at least 1 and the values
for `sigma` should be between 0 and 1.

With function [&getNestedTuneResultsOptPathDf] you can extract the optimization paths
for the 3 outer cross-validation iterations for further inspection and analysis.
These are stacked in one [data.frame](&base::data.frame) with column `iter` indicating the
resampling iteration.

```{r}
opt.paths = getNestedTuneResultsOptPathDf(r)
head(opt.paths, 10)
```

Below we visualize the `opt.path`s for the 3 outer resampling iterations.

```{r fig.asp = 0.5}
g = ggplot(opt.paths, aes(x = C, y = sigma, fill = mmce.test.mean))
g + geom_tile() + facet_wrap(~ iter)
```

Another useful function is [&getNestedTuneResultsX], which extracts the best found hyperparameter
settings for each outer resampling iteration.

```{r}
getNestedTuneResultsX(r)
```


## Feature selection

As you might recall from the section about [feature selection](feature_selection.md), [%mlr]
supports the filter and the wrapper approach.


### Wrapper methods

Wrapper methods use the performance of a learning algorithm to assess the usefulness of a
feature set. In order to select a feature subset a learner is trained repeatedly on different
feature subsets and the subset which leads to the best learner performance is chosen.

For feature selection in the inner resampling loop, you need to choose a search strategy
(function [makeFeatSelControl*](&FeatSelControl)), a performance measure and the inner
resampling strategy. Then use function [&makeFeatSelWrapper] to bind everything together.

Below we use sequential forward selection with linear regression on the
[BostonHousing](&mlbench::BostonHousing) data set ([&bh.task]).

```{r}
## Feature selection in inner resampling loop
inner = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)
lrn = makeFeatSelWrapper("regr.lm", resampling = inner,
  control = makeFeatSelControlSequential(method = "sfs"), show.info = FALSE)

## Outer resampling loop
outer = makeResampleDesc("Subsample", iters = 2)
r = resample(learner = lrn, task = bh.task, resampling = outer, extract = getFeatSelResult,
  show.info = FALSE)

r

r$measures.test
```

#### Accessing the selected features

The result of the feature selection can be extracted by function [&getFeatSelResult].
It is also possible to keep whole [models](&makeWrappedModel) by setting `models = TRUE`
when calling [&resample].

```{r}
r$extract

## Selected features in the first outer resampling iteration
r$extract[[1]]$x

## Resampled performance of the selected feature subset on the first inner training set
r$extract[[1]]$y
```

As for tuning, you can extract the optimization paths.
The resulting [data.frame](&base::data.frame)s contain, among others, binary columns for
all features, indicating if they were included in the linear regression model, and the
corresponding performances.

```{r}
opt.paths = lapply(r$extract, function(x) as.data.frame(x$opt.path))
head(opt.paths[[1]])
```


An easy-to-read version of the optimization path for sequential feature selection can be
obtained with function [&analyzeFeatSelResult].

```{r}
analyzeFeatSelResult(r$extract[[1]])
```


### Filter methods with tuning

Filter methods assign an importance value to each feature.
Based on these values you can select a feature subset by either keeping all features with importance
higher than a certain threshold or by keeping a fixed number or percentage of the highest ranking features.
Often, neither the theshold nor the number or percentage of features is known in advance
and thus tuning is necessary.

In the example below the threshold value (`fw.threshold`) is tuned in the inner resampling loop.
For this purpose the base [Learner](&makeLearner) `"regr.lm"` is wrapped two times.
First, [&makeFilterWrapper] is used to fuse linear regression with a feature filtering
preprocessing step. Then a tuning step is added by [&makeTuneWrapper].

```{r}
## Tuning of the percentage of selected filters in the inner loop
lrn = makeFilterWrapper(learner = "regr.lm", fw.method = "chi.squared")
ps = makeParamSet(makeDiscreteParam("fw.threshold", values = seq(0, 1, 0.2)))
ctrl = makeTuneControlGrid()
inner = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)
lrn = makeTuneWrapper(lrn, resampling = inner, par.set = ps, control = ctrl, show.info = FALSE)

## Outer resampling loop
outer = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)
r = resample(learner = lrn, task = bh.task, resampling = outer, models = TRUE, show.info = FALSE)
r
```

#### Accessing the selected features and optimal percentage

In the above example we kept the complete [model](&makeWrappedModel)s.

Below are some examples that show how to extract information from the [model](&makeWrappedModel)s.

```{r}
r$models
```

The result of the feature selection can be extracted by function [&getFilteredFeatures].
Almost always all 13 features are selected.

```{r}
lapply(r$models, function(x) getFilteredFeatures(x$learner.model$next.model))
```

Below the [tune results](&TuneResult) and [optimization paths](&ParamHelpers::OptPath)
are accessed.

```{r}
res = lapply(r$models, getTuneResult)
res

opt.paths = lapply(res, function(x) as.data.frame(x$opt.path))
opt.paths[[1]]
```


## Benchmark experiments

In a benchmark experiment multiple learners are compared on one or several tasks
(see also the section about [benchmarking](benchmark_experiments.md)).
Nested resampling in benchmark experiments is achieved the same way as in resampling:

* First, use [&makeTuneWrapper] or [&makeFeatSelWrapper] to generate wrapped [Learner](&makeLearner)s
  with the inner resampling strategies of your choice.
* Second, call [&benchmark] and specify the outer resampling strategies for all tasks.

The inner resampling strategies should be [resample descriptions](&makeResampleDesc).
You can use different inner resampling strategies for different wrapped learners.
For example it might be practical to do fewer subsampling or bootstrap iterations for slower
learners.

If you have larger benchmark experiments you might want to have a look at the section
about [parallelization](parallelization.md).

As mentioned in the section about [benchmark experiments](benchmark_experiments.md) you can also use
different resampling strategies for different learning tasks by passing a
[list](&base::list) of resampling descriptions or instances to [&benchmark].

We will see three examples to show different benchmark settings:

1. Two data sets + two classification algorithms + tuning
2. One data set + two regression algorithms + feature selection
3. One data set + two regression algorithms + feature filtering + tuning


### Example 1: Two tasks, two learners, tuning

Below is a benchmark experiment with two data sets, [iris](&datasets::iris) and
[sonar](&mlbench::sonar), and two [Learner](&makeLearner)s,
[ksvm](&kernlab::ksvm) and [kknn](&kknn::kknn), that are both tuned.

As inner resampling strategies we use holdout for [ksvm](&kernlab::ksvm) and subsampling
with 3 iterations for [kknn](&kknn::kknn).
As outer resampling strategies we take holdout for the [iris](&datasets::iris) and bootstrap
with 2 iterations for the [sonar](&mlbench::sonar) data ([&sonar.task]).
We consider the accuracy ([acc](measures.md)), which is used as tuning criterion, and also
calculate the balanced error rate ([ber](measures.md)).

```{r}
## List of learning tasks
tasks = list(iris.task, sonar.task)

## Tune svm in the inner resampling loop
ps = makeParamSet(
  makeDiscreteParam("C", 2^(-1:1)),
  makeDiscreteParam("sigma", 2^(-1:1)))
ctrl = makeTuneControlGrid()
inner = makeResampleDesc("Holdout")
lrn1 = makeTuneWrapper("classif.ksvm", resampling = inner, par.set = ps, control = ctrl,
  show.info = FALSE)

## Tune k-nearest neighbor in inner resampling loop
ps = makeParamSet(makeDiscreteParam("k", 3:5))
ctrl = makeTuneControlGrid()
inner = makeResampleDesc("Subsample", iters = 3)
lrn2 = makeTuneWrapper("classif.kknn", resampling = inner, par.set = ps, control = ctrl,
  show.info = FALSE)

## Learners
lrns = list(lrn1, lrn2)

## Outer resampling loop
outer = list(makeResampleDesc("Holdout"), makeResampleDesc("Bootstrap", iters = 2))
res = benchmark(lrns, tasks, outer, measures = list(acc, ber), show.info = FALSE)
res
```

The [print](&base::print) method for the [&BenchmarkResult] shows the aggregated performances
from the outer resampling loop.

As you might recall, [%mlr] offers several accessor function to extract information from
the benchmark result.
These are listed on the help page of [&BenchmarkResult] and many examples are shown on the
tutorial page about [benchmark experiments](benchmark_experiments.md).

The performance values in individual outer resampling runs can be obtained by [&getBMRPerformances].
Note that, since we used different outer resampling strategies for the two tasks, the number
of rows per task differ.

```{r}
getBMRPerformances(res, as.df = TRUE)
```

The results from the parameter tuning can be obtained through function [&getBMRTuneResults].

```{r}
getBMRTuneResults(res)
```

As for several other accessor functions a clearer representation as [data.frame](&base::data.frame)
can be achieved by setting `as.df = TRUE`.

```{r}
getBMRTuneResults(res, as.df = TRUE)
```

It is also possible to extract the tuning results for individual tasks and learners and,
as shown in earlier examples, inspect the [optimization path](&ParamHelpers::OptPath).

```{r}
tune.res = getBMRTuneResults(res, task.ids = "Sonar_example", learner.ids = "classif.ksvm.tuned",
  as.df = TRUE)
tune.res

getNestedTuneResultsOptPathDf(res$results[["Sonar_example"]][["classif.ksvm.tuned"]])
```


### Example 2: One task, two learners, feature selection

Let's see how we can do [feature selection](feature_selection.md) in
a benchmark experiment:

```{r}
## Feature selection in inner resampling loop
ctrl = makeFeatSelControlSequential(method = "sfs")
inner = makeResampleDesc("Subsample", iters = 2)
lrn = makeFeatSelWrapper("regr.lm", resampling = inner, control = ctrl, show.info = FALSE)

## Learners
lrns = list("regr.rpart", lrn)

## Outer resampling loop
outer = makeResampleDesc("Subsample", iters = 2)
res = benchmark(tasks = bh.task, learners = lrns, resampling = outer, show.info = FALSE)

res
```

The selected features can be extracted by function [&getBMRFeatSelResults].
By default, a nested [list](&base::list), with the first level indicating the task and the
second level indicating the learner, is returned.
If only a single learner or, as in our case, a single task is considered, setting
`drop = TRUE` simplifies the result to a flat [list](&base::list).

```{r}
getBMRFeatSelResults(res)
getBMRFeatSelResults(res, drop = TRUE)
```

You can access results for individual learners and tasks and inspect them further.

```{r}
feats = getBMRFeatSelResults(res, learner.id = "regr.lm.featsel", drop = TRUE)

## Selected features in the first outer resampling iteration
feats[[1]]$x

## Resampled performance of the selected feature subset on the first inner training set
feats[[1]]$y
```

As for tuning, you can extract the optimization paths. The resulting [data.frame](&base::data.frame)s
contain, among others, binary columns for all features, indicating if they were included in the
linear regression model, and the corresponding performances.
[&analyzeFeatSelResult] gives a clearer overview.

```{r}
opt.paths = lapply(feats, function(x) as.data.frame(x$opt.path))
head(opt.paths[[1]])

analyzeFeatSelResult(feats[[1]])
```


### Example 3: One task, two learners, feature filtering with tuning

Here is a minimal example for feature filtering with tuning of the feature subset size.

```{r}
## Feature filtering with tuning in the inner resampling loop
lrn = makeFilterWrapper(learner = "regr.lm", fw.method = "chi.squared")
ps = makeParamSet(makeDiscreteParam("fw.abs", values = seq_len(getTaskNFeats(bh.task))))
ctrl = makeTuneControlGrid()
inner = makeResampleDesc("CV", iter = 2)
lrn = makeTuneWrapper(lrn, resampling = inner, par.set = ps, control = ctrl,
  show.info = FALSE)

## Learners
lrns = list("regr.rpart", lrn)

## Outer resampling loop
outer = makeResampleDesc("Subsample", iter = 3)
res = benchmark(tasks = bh.task, learners = lrns, resampling = outer, show.info = FALSE)

res
```

```{r}
## Performances on individual outer test data sets
getBMRPerformances(res, as.df = TRUE)
```

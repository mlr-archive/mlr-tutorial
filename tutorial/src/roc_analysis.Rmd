# ROC Analysis and Performance Curves

For binary scoring classifiers a *threshold* (in the following also called *cutoff*) value
controls how predicted posterior probabilities are turned into class labels.
ROC curves and other performance plots serve to visualize and analyse the relationship between
one or two performance measures and the threshold.

This section is mainly devoted to *receiver operating characteristic* (ROC) curves that
plot the *true positive rate* (sensitivity) on the vertical axis against the *false positive rate*
(1 - specificity, fall-out) on the horizontal axis for all possible threshold values.
Creating other performance plots like *lift charts* or *precision/recall graphs* works
analogously and is only shown briefly.

In addition to performance visualization ROC curves are helpful in

* determining an optimal decision threshold for given class prior probabilities and
  misclassification costs (for alternatives see also the sections about
  [cost-sensitive classification](cost_sensitive_classif.md) and
  [imbalanced classification problems](over_and_undersampling.md) in this tutorial),
* identifying regions where one classifier outperforms another and building suitable multi-classifier
  systems,
* obtaining calibrated estimates of the posterior probabilities.

For more information see the tutorials and introductory papers by
[Fawcett (2004)](http://home.comcast.net/~tom.fawcett/public_html/papers/ROC101.pdf),
[Fawcett (2006)](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/mir2009/references/ROCintro.pdf)
as well as [Flach (ICML 2004)](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~flach/ICML04tutorial/index.html).

In many applications as, e.g., diagnostic tests or spam detection, there is uncertainty
about the class priors or the misclassification costs at the time of prediction, for example
because it's hard to quantify the costs or because costs and class priors vary over time.
Under these circumstances the classifier is expected to work well for a whole range of
decision thresholds and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) provides a scalar performance
measure for comparing and selecting classifiers.
[%mlr] provides the AUC for binary classification ([auc](measures.md) based on package
[ROCR](&ROCR::performance)) an also a generalization of the AUC for the
multi-class case ([multiclass.auc](measures.md) based on package [pROC](&pROC::multiclass)).

[%mlr] offers three ways to plot ROC and other performance curves.

1. [%mlr]'s function [&generateROCRCurvesData] is a convenient interface to [%ROCR]'s
   [performance](&ROCR::performance) methods with an associated plotting function,
   [&plotROCRCurves] which uses [%ggplot2].
2. The [%mlr] function [&asROCRPrediction] converts [%mlr] [&Prediction] objects to objects
   of [%ROCR]'s class [prediction](&ROCR::prediction-class).
   Then, [%ROCR]'s functionality can be used to further analyse the results and generate
   performance plots.
3. [%mlr]'s function [&plotViperCharts] provides an interface to
   [ViperCharts](http://viper.ijs.si).

Let's have a look at some examples demonstrating the three possible methods.

Note that the [learners](learner.md) have to be capable of predicting probabilities.
Have a look at the [table of learners](integrated_learners.md)
or run `listLearners(prob = TRUE)` to get a list of all learners that support this.


## Performance plots with generateROCRCurvesData and plotROCRCurves

As mentioned above [&generateROCRCurvesData] is an interface to [%ROCR]'s
[performance](&ROCR::performance) methods.
It provides S3 methods for objects of class [&Prediction], [&ResampleResult]
and [&BenchmarkResult] (resulting from calling [predict](&predict.WrappedModel), [&resample]
or [&benchmark]). [&plotROCRCurves] plots output from [&generateROCRCurvesData] using [%ggplot2].


### Example 1: Single predictions

We consider the [Sonar](&mlbench::Sonar) data set from package [%mlbench], which poses a
binary classification problem ([&sonar.task]) and apply [linear discriminant analysis](&MASS::lda).

```{r}
lrn1 = makeLearner("classif.lda", predict.type = "prob")

mod1 = train(lrn1, sonar.task)
pred1 = predict(mod1, task = sonar.task)
roc_data = generateROCRCurvesData(pred1)
roc_data
```
[&generateROCRCurvesData] returns an object of class "ROCRCurvesData" which contains the results from [%ROCR]'s [performance](&ROCR::performance) method (which depends on arguments `meas1` and `meas2`). The data can be extracted by accessing the data element of the object. The object also contains information about the input arguments to `generateROCRCurvesData` which may be useful.

Per default, [&plotROCRCurves] draws a ROC curve and optionally adds a diagonal line that represents
the performance of a random classifier.

```{r}
droc = generateROCRCurvesData(pred1)
plotROCRCurves(droc, diagonal = TRUE)
```
There is also an experimental plotting function [&plotROCRCurvesGGVIS] which uses [%ggvis] to create similar
figures with the addition of (optional) interactive tooltips (displayed on hover) that display the threshold
at that point in the curve.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plotROCRCurvesGGVIS(droc, cutoffs = TRUE)
```

The corresponding area under curve ([auc](measures.md)) can be calculated as usual by calling
[&performance].

```{r}
performance(pred1, auc)
```

In addition to [linear discriminant analysis](&MASS::lda) we try a support vector machine
with RBF kernel ([ksvm](&kernlab::ksvm)).

```{r}
lrn2 = makeLearner("classif.ksvm", predict.type = "prob")
mod2 = train(lrn2, sonar.task)
pred2 = predict(mod2, task = sonar.task)
```

In order to compare the performance of the two learners you might want to display the two
corresponding ROC curves in one plot.
For this purpose just pass a named [list](&base::list) of [&Prediction]s to [&plotROCRCurves].

```{r}
plotROCRCurves(generateROCRCurvesData(list(lda = pred1, ksvm = pred2)))
```

It's clear from the plot above that [ksvm](&kernlab::ksvm) has a slightly higher AUC than
[lda](&MASS::lda).

```{r}
performance(pred2, auc)
```

It is easily possible to generate other performance plots by passing the appropriate performance
measures to [&plotROCRCurves].
Note that arguments `meas1` and `meas2` do not refer to [%mlr]'s performance measures,
but to measures provided by [%ROCR] and listed [here](&ROCR::performance).
Below is code for a *lift chart* which shows the lift value (`"lift"`) versus the rate of
positive predictions (`"rpp"`).

```{r}
out = generateROCRCurvesData(list(lda = pred1, ksvm = pred2), meas1 = "lift", meas2 = "rpp")
plotROCRCurves(out)
```

A plot of a single performance measure (accuracy in the example code below) versus the
threshold can be generated by setting `meas2 = "cutoff"`.

```{r}
out = generateROCRCurvesData(list(lda = pred1, ksvm = pred2), meas1 = "acc", meas2 = "cutoff")
plotROCRCurves(out)
```

As you may recall, an alternative function for plotting performance values versus the decision
threshold is [&plotThreshVsPerf].
While [&plotThreshVsPerf] permits to plot several performance measures at once,
[&plotROCRCurves] makes it easy to superpose the performance curves of multiple learners.


### Example 2: Benchmark experiment

The analysis in the example above can be improved in several regards.
We only considered the training performance and, ideally, the support vector machine should
have been [tuned](tune.md).
Moreover, we wrote individual code for training/prediction of each learner, which can become
tedious very quickly.
A more practical way to apply several learners to a [&Task] and compare their performance is
provided by function [&benchmark] (see also [Benchmark Experiments](benchmark_experiments.md)).

We again consider the [Sonar](&mlbench::Sonar) data set and apply [lda](&MASS::lda)
as well as [ksvm](&kernlab::ksvm).
We first generate a [tuning wrapper](&makeTuneWrapper) for [ksvm](&kernlab::ksvm).
The cost parameter is tuned on a (for demonstration purposes small) parameter grid.
We assume that we are interested in a good performance over the complete threshold range
and therefore tune with regard to the [auc](measures.md).
The error rate ([mmce](measures.md)) for threshold 0.5 is reported as well.

```{r}
## Tune wrapper for ksvm
rdesc.inner = makeResampleDesc("Holdout")
ms = list(auc, mmce)
ps = makeParamSet(
  makeDiscreteParam("C", 2^(-1:1))
)
ctrl = makeTuneControlGrid()
lrn2 = makeTuneWrapper(lrn2, rdesc.inner, ms, ps, ctrl, show.info = FALSE)
```

Below the actual benchmark experiment is conducted.
As resampling strategy we use 5-fold cross-validation and again calculate the [auc](measures.md)
as well as the error rate (for a threshold/cutoff value of 0.5).

```{r}
## Benchmark experiment
lrns = list(lrn1, lrn2)
rdesc.outer = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 5)

res = benchmark(lrns, tasks = sonar.task, resampling = rdesc.outer, measures = ms, show.info = FALSE)
res
```

Calling [&plotROCRCurves] on the [result](&BenchmarkResult) of the benchmark experiment
produces a plot with ROC curves for all learners in the experiment.

```{r}
plotROCRCurves(generateROCRCurvesData(res))
```

Per default, threshold-averaged ROC curves are shown.
Since we used 5-fold cross-validation we have predictions on 5 test data sets and therefore
5 ROC curves per classifier.
For each threshold value the means of the corresponding 5 false and true positive rates are
calculated and plotted against each other.

If you want to plot the individual ROC curves for each resample iteration set `avg = "none"`.
Other available options are `avg = "horizontal"` and `avg = "vertical"`.

```{r}
plotROCRCurves(generateROCRCurvesData(res, avg = "none"))
```

An alternative to averaging is to just merge the 5 test folds and draw a single ROC curve.
Merging can be achieved by manually changing the [class](&base::class) attribute of
the prediction objects from [&ResamplePrediction] to [&Prediction].

Below the predictions are extracted from the [&BenchmarkResult] via function [&getBMRPredictions],
the [class](&base::class) is changed and the ROC curves are created.

Averaging methods are normally preferred
(cp. [Fawcett, 2006](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/mir2009/references/ROCintro.pdf)),
as they permit to assess the variability, which is needed to properly compare classifier
performance.

```{r}
## Extract predictions
preds = getBMRPredictions(res)[[1]]

## Change the class attribute
preds2 = lapply(preds, function(x) {class(x) = "Prediction"; return(x)})

## Draw ROC curves
plotROCRCurves(generateROCRCurvesData(preds2, avg = "none"))
```

Again, you can easily create other standard evaluation plots by calling [&plotROCRCurves]
on the [&BenchmarkResult] with the appropriate performance measures (see [&ROCR::performance]).


## Performance plots with asROCRPrediction

Drawing performance plots with package [%ROCR] works through three basic commands:

1. [&ROCR::prediction]: Create a [%ROCR] [prediction](&ROCR::prediction-class) object.
2. [&ROCR::performance]: Calculate one or more performance measures for the
   given prediction object.
3. A reimplementation of [ROCR::plot](&ROCR::plot-methods) which uses [&ggplot2].

[%mlr]'s function [&asROCRPrediction] converts an [%mlr] [&Prediction] object to
a [%ROCR] [prediction](&ROCR::prediction-class) object.
In order to create performance plots steps 2. and 3. have to be run by the user.

This is obviously less convenient than calling [&plotROCRCurves] (which extracts predictions,
calls [&asROCRPrediction] and executes steps 2. and 3. internally).
On the other hand this way provides more control over the generated plots by, e.g., using graphical
parameters that are not (yet) accessible via [&plotROCRCurves].
Moreover, you can directly benefit from any enhancements in [%ROCR], use your own
[%ROCR]-based code or other packages that depend on [%ROCR], and use [&ROCR]'s [plot](&ROCR::plot-methods).
For more details see the [%ROCR] documentation and `demo(ROCR)`.

An addditional alternative is to call [&plotROCRCurves], extract the data from the [&ggplot2] object using the `data` element of the object, e.g., `obj$data`, and then plot the data using whatever method you prefer.


### Example 1: Single predictions (continued)

We go back to out first example where we trained and predicted [lda](&MASS::lda) on the
[sonar classification task](&sonar.task).

```{r}
## Train and predict linear discriminant analysis
lrn1 = makeLearner("classif.lda", predict.type = "prob")
mod1 = train(lrn1, sonar.task)
pred1 = predict(mod1, task = sonar.task)
```

Below we use [&asROCRPrediction] to convert the lda prediction, let [%ROCR] calculate the
true and false positive rate and plot the ROC curve.

```{r}
## Convert prediction
ROCRpred1 = asROCRPrediction(pred1)

## Calculate true and false positive rate
ROCRperf1 = ROCR::performance(ROCRpred1, "tpr", "fpr")

## Draw ROC curve
ROCR::plot(ROCRperf1)
```

Below is the same ROC curve, but we make use of some more graphical parameters:
The ROC curve is color-coded by the threshold and selected threshold values are printed on
the curve. Additionally, the convex hull (black broken line) of the ROC curve is drawn.

```{r}
## Draw ROC curve
ROCR::plot(ROCRperf1, colorize = TRUE, print.cutoffs.at = seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1), lwd = 2)

## Draw convex hull of ROC curve
ch = ROCR::performance(ROCRpred1, "rch")
ROCR::plot(ch, add = TRUE, lty = 2)
```


### Example 2: Benchmark experiments (continued)

We again consider the benchmark experiment conducted earlier.
We first extract the predictions by [&getBMRPredictions] and then convert them via function
[&asROCRPrediction].

```{r}
## Extract predictions
preds = getBMRPredictions(res)[[1]]

## Convert predictions
ROCRpreds = lapply(preds, asROCRPrediction)

## Calculate true and false positive rate
ROCRperfs = lapply(ROCRpreds, function(x) ROCR::performance(x, "tpr", "fpr"))
```

We draw the horizontally averaged ROC curves (solid lines) as well as the ROC curves for
the individual resampling iterations (broken lines).
Moreover, standard error bars are plotted for selected true positive rates (0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9).
See [%ROCR]'s [plot](&ROCR::plot-methods) function for details.

```{r}
## lda average ROC curve
ROCR::plot(ROCRperfs[[1]], col = "blue", avg = "horizontal", spread.estimate = "stderror",
  show.spread.at = seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1), plotCI.col = "blue", plotCI.lwd = 2, lwd = 2)
## lda individual ROC curves
ROCR::plot(ROCRperfs[[1]], col = "blue", lty = 2, lwd = 0.25, add = TRUE)

## ksvm average ROC curve
ROCR::plot(ROCRperfs[[2]], col = "red", avg = "horizontal", spread.estimate = "stderror",
  show.spread.at = seq(0.4, 0.9, 0.1), plotCI.col = "red", plotCI.lwd = 2, lwd = 2, add = TRUE)
## ksvm individual ROC curves
ROCR::plot(ROCRperfs[[2]], col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 0.25, add = TRUE)

legend("bottomright", legend = getBMRLearnerIds(res), lty = 1, lwd = 2, col = c("blue", "red"))
```

In order to create other evaluation plots like *precision/recall graphs* you just have to change
the performance measures when calling [&ROCR::performance].

```{r}
## Extract and convert predictions
preds = getBMRPredictions(res)[[1]]
ROCRpreds = lapply(preds, asROCRPrediction)

## Calculate precision and recall
ROCRperfs = lapply(ROCRpreds, function(x) ROCR::performance(x, "prec", "rec"))

## Draw performance plot
ROCR::plot(ROCRperfs[[1]], col = "blue", avg = "threshold")
ROCR::plot(ROCRperfs[[2]], col = "red", avg = "threshold", add = TRUE)
legend("bottomleft", legend = getBMRLearnerIds(res), lty = 1, col = c("blue", "red"))
```

If you want to plot a performance measure versus the threshold, specify only one measure when
calling [&ROCR::performance].
Below the average accuracy over the 5 cross-validation iterations is plotted against the
threshold. Moreover, boxplots for certain threshold values (0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9) are drawn.

```{r}
## Extract and convert predictions
preds = getBMRPredictions(res)[[1]]
ROCRpreds = lapply(preds, asROCRPrediction)

## Calculate accuracy
ROCRperfs = lapply(ROCRpreds, function(x) ROCR::performance(x, "acc"))

## Plot accuracy versus threshold
ROCR::plot(ROCRperfs[[1]], avg = "vertical", spread.estimate = "boxplot", lwd = 2, col = "blue",
  show.spread.at = seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1), ylim = c(0,1), xlab = "Threshold")
```


## Viper charts

[%mlr] also supports [ViperCharts](http://viper.ijs.si/) for plotting ROC and other performance
curves. Like [&plotROCRCurves] it has S3 methods for objects of class [&Prediction],
[&ResampleResult] and [&BenchmarkResult].
Below plots for the benchmark experiment (Example 2) are generated.

```{r}
z = plotViperCharts(res, chart = "rocc", browse = FALSE)
```

You can see the plot created this way [here](`r z`).
Note that besides ROC curves you get several other plots like lift charts or cost curves.
For details, see [&plotViperCharts].
